## Introduce to this repo
* This is my repo for STATS 220.
* The purpose of this repository is to get familiar with the basic concepts of coding in R files and R markdown files and using Github pages.
## First mission
The first thing is to create a meme by R and show it with a markdown file on [Github](https://github.com/vickycuii/stats-220). You can check it in [project1 report](file:///Users/cuixinyue/Desktop/stats220/Project1/project1_report.html)
