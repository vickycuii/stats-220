## Project requirements
This is my GitHub Page Link: https://github.com/vickycuii/stats-220

This is my GitHub Webiste link: file:///Users/cuixinyue/Desktop/stats220/Project1/project1_report.html

In this response, I've met the requirements related to working with GitHub by:

1.Creating a new repository named "stats220" on GitHub. 2.Including a README.md file in the repository, providing information about the purpose of the repository using Markdown syntax. 3.Demonstrating how to download an image from a URL and displaying it in RStudio. 4.Also in part one, I made a meme by R. I also writw the README.md to intorduce the repo for the people who can have a chance to visit my page online.
While thinking and creating, I came up with some interesting creative elements. I like cats very much, so in meme production, I chose pictures of cats to complete this creation. For animation creation, I used my favorite One of my favorite patterns: hearts.

## My meme
This is a meme that I created about the emotion for 'go to school' and 'off school'. I think this is a interesting topic. I have changed the function and text for my meme. 

![](my_meme.png){width="318"}

```{r meme-code, eval=TRUE}
library(magick)
#first meme
way_to_school <- image_read(path = "file:///Users/cuixinyue/Desktop/stats220/inspo_meme2.png")%>%
  image_resize("500x500!")
#second meme
finish_school <-image_read(path = "file:///Users/cuixinyue/Desktop/stats220/inspo_meme.png")%>%
  image_resize("500x500!")

#first text
#the box
school_text <- image_blank(width = 500, height = 500, color = "#FFFFFF")%>%
  #the text
  image_annotate(text = "On my way to school", 
                 color = "#000000", 
                 size = 60, 
                 font = "Impact", 
                 gravity = "center")

#second text
#the box
finish_text <- image_blank(width = 500, height = 500, color = "#000000")%>%
  #the text
  image_annotate(text = "On my way finish school", 
                 color = "#FFFFFF", 
                 size = 50, 
                 font = "Impact", 
                 gravity = "center")

# append the first meme and text together
top_row <- image_append(c(school_text, way_to_school))
bottom_row <- image_append(c(finish_text, finish_school))

#the whole meme
meme <- c(top_row, bottom_row)%>%
  image_append(stack = TRUE)%>%
  image_scale(800)

#save meme
image_write(meme, "my_meme.png")

```
This is animation meme that I created. I really like cats a lot, so I found one of my favorite patterns: a red heart as a representation. 
![](my_animation.gif){width="273"}

```{r animation-code, eval=FALSE}
library(magick)
#creating vector
counts <- 1 : 4 %>% as.character()

heart_image <- image_read("file:///Users/cuixinyue/Desktop/stats220/inspo_heart.png")%>%
  image_scale(500)

#creating frame
frame1 <- heart_image %>%
  image_annotate(text = counts[3], size = 100, gravity = "center") %>%
  image_scale(200) %>%
  image_extent("500x500!")
frame2 <- heart_image %>%
  image_annotate(text = counts[2], size = 100, gravity = "center") %>%
  image_scale(300) %>%
  image_extent("500x500!")
frame3 <- heart_image %>%
  image_annotate(text = counts[1], size = 100, gravity = "center") %>%
  image_scale(400) %>%
  image_extent("500x500!")
frame4 <- heart_image %>%
  image_annotate(text = "love you!", size = 100, gravity = "center") %>%
  image_scale(500) %>%
  image_extent("500x500!")

#put each frame together
frames <- c(frame1, frame2, frame3, frame4)

#creating the animation image
graph <- image_animate(frames, fps = 1)

#save the image in my laptop
image_write(graph, "my_animation.gif")
```

## Creativity

In a project combining the power of RStudio and GitHub, I used more CSS than needed to change the appearance of the HTML and make it look more beautiful. For the meme image creation process, I used some basic functions but got some different pictures. In GitHub, I added more novel content, such as my own interests and hobbies and added the Rmd web page in my Github.

## Learning reflection

HTML is used everywhere, which was one of the main lessons I learned from Module 1’s lesson. In this project and study, I realized the development and greatness of modern technology. We can use some modern information, such as programming, to show different results. I initially thought that programming R language and creating HTML was a very difficult thing. After completing this project, I found that it was not as difficult as I thought. I could use different function equations to create different pictures. I would like to learn more about the HTML and how I can use it to make more things, such as intricate diagrams, movies, and other things.
